DESCRIPTION OF YOUR CLASS DESIGN AND ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES USED:

Class:
Rack - can get the subnets of a word
AnagramDictionary - can get anagrams of a word
ScoreTable - put all letters and their scores in a map, and can get the score of a word
WordFinder - main class
I use a set to store all result words and a map for storing the words and their corresponding scores. Then sort the map by value then by key, to make words in alphabetical order if having same scores.
